# Setup

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(naniar)
library(DHARMa)
library(gtsummary)
library(broom)

lizards <- read.csv("jrn_lizard.csv")
lizard_npp <- read.csv("jrn_lizard_npp.csv")

```

# Logistic Regression

Do snout-to-vent length, sex, and vegetation zone at time of capture significantly predict if a lizard tail is recorded as whole?

## Data Tidying

```{r}

lizards <- lizards %>%
  filter(spp == "UTST")

```

## Examine Data

```{r}

(hist1 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = SV_length)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    theme_bw())

(hist2 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = sex)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist3 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = zone)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist4 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist5 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = SV_length,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist6 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = sex,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist7 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = zone,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

```

## Fit Regression Model

```{r}

lizards$sex <- factor(lizards$sex, 
                      levels = c("F", "J", "M", "NA"))

lizards$zone <- factor(lizards$zone,
                       levels = c("C", "G", "M", "T"))

lizards$tail <- factor(lizards$tail,
                       levels = c("B", "W", "NA"))

tail_mod <- glm(tail ~ SV_length + zone + sex, 
                data = lizards,
                family = "binomial")

summary(tail_mod)

simulateResiduals(tail_mod) %>% plot()

```

# Poisson Regression

Do season and plant species percent cover significantly predict lizard counts?

```{r}

(hist8 <- ggplot(data = lizard_npp, aes(x = season)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist9 <- ggplot(data = lizard_npp, aes(x = BOER)) +
    geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist10 <- ggplot(data = lizard_npp, aes(x = LATR)) +
    geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist11 <- ggplot(data = lizard_npp, aes(x = PRGL)) +
    geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist12 <- ggplot(data = lizard_npp, aes(x = SCBR)) +
    geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist13 <- ggplot(data = lizard_npp, aes = lizard_count)) +
  geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE)

(hist12 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = SV_length,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist13 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = sex,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist14 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = zone,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())
