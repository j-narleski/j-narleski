# Setup

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(naniar)
library(DHARMa)
library(gtsummary)
library(broom)

lizards <- read.csv("jrn_lizard.csv")
lizard_npp <- read.csv("jrn_lizard_npp.csv")

```

# Logistic Regression

Do snout-to-vent length, sex, and vegetation zone at time of capture significantly predict if a lizard tail is recorded as whole?

## Data Tidying

```{r}

lizards <- lizards %>%
  filter(spp == "UTST")

```

## Examine Data

```{r}

(hist1 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = SV_length)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    theme_bw())

(hist2 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = sex)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist3 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = zone)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist4 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist5 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = SV_length,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist6 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = sex,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

(hist7 <- ggplot(data = lizards, aes(x = zone,
                                            fill = tail)) +
    geom_histogram(stat = "count", na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw())

```
